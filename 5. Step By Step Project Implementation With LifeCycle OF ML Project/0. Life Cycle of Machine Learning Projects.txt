Life Cycle of a Machine Learning Project

1. Load the Dataset
2. Divide the Dataset into Independent and Dependent features
3. Train - Test Spilt the Dataset
4. Standardize the Training Independent Dataset
5. Apply the Machine Learning Model
6. Check the Performance using Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and R^2 Score
